    oshkosh, eau claire, uwsp, stout, whitewater etc.
A user look for prs by event groun
A user can look for prs by individuals name
*Implement ajax for above search*
NEEDED IMPROVMENT Display event names instead of sp,dt,100 etc
User can click on any mark and go the the link for the meet for that pr (NEED TO ADD SCRPAING SUPPORT FOR THIS)
User can click on the event for the pr for a person and go to their schools page with the prs for that event
User can click the tfrrs link below the name/next to the name of the athlete to go to their tfrrs profile
After click school, the user is shown prs at the most recent 4 meets, add disclaimer at bottom for how it works
    i.e if you pr at last meet and most recent only shows pr at most recent so as time goes on # of prs at older
    meets will decreaase
